## Overview
The RetroArch Web Player is RetroArch compiled through [Emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/). RetroArch is the reference frontend for the libretro API.
Popular examples of implementations for this API includes video game system emulators and game engines as well as more generalized 3D programs.
These programs are instantiated as dynamic libraries. We refer to these as "libretro cores". In our case, these cores are emulators

* cannot save game, in fact, cannot write at all... so configuration is lost each time you start again
* no user management
* some core are listed but not implemented : they do not work, the issue is from the upstream app.
* Games are located in `/opt/yunohost/retroarch/assets/cores`. A symbolic link is created to this folder in `/home/yunohost.multimedia/share/Games`, so that you can place your games from here
* cores have to be indexed to work : script `/opt/yunohost/retroarch/indexer.sh` run every 5 minutes to index all games in `opt/yunohost/retroarch/assets/cores`

**Shipped version:** 1.9.1
